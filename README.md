Eddy Covariance data collection system

This program is being offered to the eddy covariance community as a service from the AmeriFlux Tech Team.
The code comes with no guarantees, and you may use it at your own risk.  We will attempt to keep the code up to
date as instruments evolve, but.... again, no guarantees.  If you have questions please address them to dbillesbach1@unl.edu
